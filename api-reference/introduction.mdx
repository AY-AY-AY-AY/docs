## AthenaHQ API

The AthenaHQ API enables programmatic and scalable interaction with the AthenaHQ platform. Build custom integrations, automate workflows, and extend AthenaHQ's capabilities to meet your organization's specific needs.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. API keys are managed through your organization's dashboard and can be scoped to specific websites for granular access control.
