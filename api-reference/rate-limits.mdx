## Rate Limits

The AthenaHQ API enforces the following rate limits:

- **60 requests per minute** per API key
- **No limit** on total number of requests

Rate limits are enforced on a per-API-key basis. If you exceed the rate limit, subsequent requests will be rejected until the rate limit window resets.

## API Availability

<Warning>
  The AthenaHQ API is available exclusively for Enterprise accounts as an add-on feature. Contact your account manager to enable API access for your organization.
