## Rate Limits

The AthenaHQ API enforces the following rate limits:

- **60 requests per minute** per API key
- **No limit** on total number of requests

Rate limits are enforced on a per-API-key basis. If you exceed the rate limit, subsequent requests will be rejected until the rate limit window resets.

## Response Headers

All authenticated API responses include rate limit headers:

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `x-rate-limit-limit` | Maximum requests allowed per minute (60) |
| `x-rate-limit-remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `x-rate-limit-reset` | Unix timestamp (seconds) when the rate limit resets |

When you exceed the rate limit (429 response), an additional header is included:

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `retry-after` | Seconds to wait before retrying |
