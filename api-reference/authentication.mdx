## API Key Authentication

All API requests must include an API key in the request headers. API keys are passed using the `x-api-key` header.

```bash
curl https://api.athenahq.ai/v1/endpoint \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
```

## Creating API Keys

API keys can be created and managed through your organization's dashboard.

## API Key Scoping

API keys belong to an organization and can be scoped to specific websites within that organization. This allows for granular access control when managing multiple websites under a single organization.

- Each API key is associated with an organization
- Organizations can contain multiple websites
- API keys can be scoped to one or more specific websites
- Scoped API keys only have access to data from their assigned websites

<Warning>
  Only organization admins can create, edit, or delete API keys. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions before attempting to manage API keys.
